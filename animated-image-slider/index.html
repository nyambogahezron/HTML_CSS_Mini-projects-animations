            <p>We cannot promise to fix every bug right away. If the bug is obvious, critical, or affects a lot of users,
                chances are good that someone will look into it. It could also happen that we tell you to update to
                a newer version to see if the bug happens there. Or we might decide that the bug cannot be fixed
                before some major rewrite we might be planning is done. Or perhaps it is simply too hard and there are
                more important things on the agenda. If you need help immediately, consider obtaining a commercial
                support contract.
